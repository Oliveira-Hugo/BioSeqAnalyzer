# Bioinformatics
Authoral Julia code for solving bioinformatics/computational biology problems

The program is divided into a main function that parses single sequence information (main_single_seq.jl) and one that parses multiple sequences (main_multiple_seq.jl).
All required functions are called by the main, and the user only needs to insert the input and select the parsing option.
